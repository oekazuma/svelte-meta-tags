title: JSON-LD
---

JSON-LD allows for more customized and richer display, such as in search results.

To discover all the different content types that JSON-LD offers, go to: https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/search-gallery

Tips: If you want to handle multiple JSON-LDs on one page, pass an array to the `schema`.

This plugin uses [schema-dts](https://github.com/google/schema-dts) and therefore provides additional types beyond those listed in the documentation.
